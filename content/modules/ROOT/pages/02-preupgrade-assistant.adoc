== Running the pre-upgrade assistant and resolving issues

Built into the leapp tool is a utility that collects data about the
system, assesses upgradability, and generates a pre-upgrade report. On
your lab system, perform the pre-upgrade test: (This process will take a
couple minutes.)

[source,bash,run]
----
leapp preupgrade --target 8.10
----

Notice how the upgrade was "`inhibited`" because the preupgrade
assistant requires your input on one or more issues before it will
safely proceed. The preupgrade tool has generated an answerfile in
`+/var/log/leapp+`. Inside of this file, it has generated a true/false
question regarding PAM PKCS11 modules:

[source,bash,run]
----
cat /var/log/leapp/answerfile
----
